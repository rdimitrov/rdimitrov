## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rado and I work at Stacklok on things related to supply chain security, AI and MCP servers. Currently I'm a maintainer of [toolhive](https://github.com/stacklok/toolhive), [minder](https://github.com/mindersec/minder) and [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf) and Iâ€™ve spent the past several years mostly in open source and supply chain security. Previously I was at VMwareâ€™s OSPO where I contributed to several CNCF projects like [TheUpdateFramework(TUF)](https://theupdateframework.com/), [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) and [Network Service Mesh](https://networkservicemesh.io/).

Outside of work I've been doing mountainbiking since highschool (downhill then, enduro now) and enjoy all sorts of DIY stuff - from manufacturing furniture and carpentry to restoring old Gaggia coffee machines. At home I share life with a boy toddler and a tuxedo cat who are teaching me more about chaos engineering than I ever wanted to know ðŸ˜„
